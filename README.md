accessible through any web browser, this is a new ecosystem developed around the coin daemon to provide 
expanded set of services and remove limitations of the block chain. The coin daemon is used by the 
developers only as tool that maintains the blockchain and revert focus on the creation of a platform that 
supports the e-commerce and development part of the currency. The block chain acts to maintain the integrity 
of the network, while the Platform acts to integrate a wide range of services previously not easily supported.
